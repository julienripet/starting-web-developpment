My take on the exercice given at 
https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Lovelace-3.9/blob/master/parcours/01-La-prairie/html-css/8-exercice-summary.md
for which I had to copy as best as I could the following image 
![](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Lovelace-3.9/blob/master/parcours/01-La-prairie/html-css/images/goal-css.png)

I worked on this for 3 hours today, and made the html the previous week.
It's not a perfect copy, but it's as good as I can currently get. I might update it later on.
